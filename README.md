# batterystatus-sal-plugin

This is the plugin for [Sal](https://github.com/salopensource/sal). Many thanks to [Graham Gilbert](https://github.com/grahamgilbert) for his work.

This plugin renders info about battery cycles and battery failure status from [facter](https://docs.puppet.com/facter/) (You need to use additional facts)

Check this [page](https://github.com/salopensource/sal/wiki/Installing-and-using-plugins) for installation guide.
